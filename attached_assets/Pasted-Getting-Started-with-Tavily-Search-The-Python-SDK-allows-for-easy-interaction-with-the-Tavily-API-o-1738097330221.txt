Getting Started with Tavily Search
The Python SDK allows for easy interaction with the Tavily API, offering the full range of our search functionality directly from your Python programs. Easily integrate smart search capabilities into your applications, harnessing Tavily's powerful search features.

üì¶ Installing
pip install tavily-python

üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Below are some code snippets that show you how to interact with our API. The different steps and components of this code are explained in more detail on the Python API Reference page.

Getting and printing the full Search API response
from tavily import TavilyClient

# Step 1. Instantiating your TavilyClient
tavily_client = TavilyClient(api_key="tvly-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Step 2. Executing a simple search query
response = tavily_client.search("Who is Leo Messi?")

# Step 3. That's it! You've done a Tavily Search!
print(response)

This is equivalent to directly querying our REST API.

Generating context for a RAG Application
from tavily import TavilyClient

# Step 1. Instantiating your TavilyClient
tavily_client = TavilyClient(api_key="tvly-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Step 2. Executing a context search query
context = tavily_client.get_search_context(query="What happened during the Burning Man floods?")

# Step 3. That's it! You now have a context string that you can feed directly into your RAG Application
print(context)

This is how you can generate precise and fact-based context for your RAG application in one line of code.

Getting a quick answer to a question
from tavily import TavilyClient

# Step 1. Instantiating your TavilyClient
tavily_client = TavilyClient(api_key="tvly-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Step 2. Executing a Q&A search query
answer = tavily_client.qna_search(query="Who is Leo Messi?")

# Step 3. That's it! Your question has been answered!
print(answer)

This is how you get accurate and concise answers to questions, in one line of code. Perfect for usage by LLMs!
